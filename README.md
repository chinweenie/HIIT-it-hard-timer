# HIIT it hard timer

## Architecture and Technologies
This application was built with pure Javascript.

## Background
HIIT it hard timer is a customizable HIIT workout timer where users can pick:
* the length work interval
* the length of rest interval
* number of rounds
* type of exercises
* total number sets 
* A good example is the classic HIIT 50 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest or
a TABATA session of 20 seconds work and 10 seconds rest.
* During the 50 seconds of work, a giphy will be displayed to show users what 
exercise they need to do for that interval.
